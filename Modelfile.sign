4. Classifiers noted as CL: followed by description
5. Topic-comment structure is standard in most sign languages
6. Directional verbs show movement: GIVE-me, GIVE-you
7. Time signs typically come first: YESTERDAY ME GO STORE
8. Questions marked with non-manual markers: (eyebrows raised) or (eyebrows furrowed)
9. Negation often at end or with head shake: ME GO NOT or ME NOT GO (head shake)
10. Plurals shown with repetition or sweep: BOOK++ or BOOK-SWEEP
